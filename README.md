# Google Data Analytics Capstone 1
## Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

This case study is the Capstone Project of [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). The 6 steps of Data Analysis is used to present this analysis.

### Background
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oering. Since then, the program has grown to a eet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the exibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s nance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more protable than casual riders. Although the pricing exibility helps Cyclistic aract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

### Business Question
So here are the analysis questions that will help in the analysis:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. What are the causes that drive casual riders to buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media as a tool to convert casual riders to members?
For this case, Lily Moreno who is the director of marketing has assigned me as a junior data analyst to the first question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

### Business Task
To better understand how annual members and casual riders differ for designing a marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

### Tools:
Python for Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualisation and Data Analysis
